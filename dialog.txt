Bot: (neutral) How do you do.  Please tell me your problem.
You: (joy) Hi!
Bot: (sadness) I'm not sure I understand you fully.
You: (anger) What don't you understand?
Bot: (neutral) Why do you ask ?
You: (anger) I ask becausae you are being an idiot.

You: (joy) haaha what?
Bot: (neutral) Please go on.

Bot: (neutral) Do you feel strongly about discussing such things ?
You: (neutral) not really.
Bot: (sadness) I'm not sure I understand you fully.
You: (joy) are you sad? haha
Bot: (surprise) Why are you interested in whether I am sad? haha or not ?
You: (neutral) you seem sad, which is weird, cuz you are just a bot.
Bot: (anger) What makes you think I am just a bot ?
You: (anger) what else can you be? you are a heartless creature, just 1's and 0's.
Bot: (neutral) Does that question interest you ?
